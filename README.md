# Accessible Constitution

## Description
This is a project meant to replace Computer Science House's Consitution with an interactive website that is more accessible for those who might have trouble reading it in its current form. The current website, which is just a PDF, can be found [here](https://constitution.csh.rit.edu). This website, built using Next.js, aims to add different fonts to the Constitution to increase readability, audio voiceovers, and a searchable version so that you don't need to know the exact terminology to find what you're looking for.

## Viewing
Since this website is currently not being publicly hosted anywhere, you can see the website by downloading the code from this repository, navigating to the directory, then running `npm run dev` or `npm run build` for development and production builds respectively. By default, the page will render at `localhost:3000` on your machine. Note: this does require a recent version of Node.js in order to build properly. You can find more about downloading Node.js directly [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and how to do it through common package managers [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
